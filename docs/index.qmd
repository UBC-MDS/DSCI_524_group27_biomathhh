# Welcome to Biomathhh

**Biomathhh** is a Python package that provides simple, well tested functions for common biological calculations. Below you will find a quick start on how to use the package functions.

## Installation
```bash
pip install biomathhh
```

## Quick Start

Here are examples of how to use each function:

### Calculate Dilution


### Exponential Growth


### pH Calculation
Calculate pH scale for a given hydronium concentration

```python
from biomathhh.pH_scale import calculate_pH

hydronium_concentration = 1e-4
ph_value = calculate_pH(hydronium_concentration)

print(ph_value)
```
```python
Output:
4.0
```

### Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index
The Shannon Wiener index quantifies species diversity by accounting for both species richness and evenness.

```python
from biomathhh.sw_diversity_index import sw_diversity_index

species_counts = [50, 30, 20]
diversity_index = sw_diversity_index(species_counts)

print(diversity_index)
```
```python
Output:
1.0297
```
